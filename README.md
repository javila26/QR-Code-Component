## Overview

This is my first Frontend Mentor project to put in practice my HTML and CSS skills I learned in the last months. By following these challenges I pretend to develop good practice and better understanding of one of most two important technologies from the web development world.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Media Queries

### What I learned

I put in practice the most basic knowledge about CSS Flex I had to keep everything centered, this little component also helped me understanding the importance of not using fixed values so it can reescalate easier when changing size screen.

### Continued development

After developing this little exercise I set my set the goal of making at leat one challenge per week. I made two more that I am about to upload.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [W3Schools CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - Having always a bit code to mess with and make sure of understanding a property comes very handy.
